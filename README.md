**jkl** is a static site generator written in [Go](http://www.golang.org),
based on [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/drone/jkl/status.png)](https://drone.io/drone/jkl/latest)

Notable similarities between jkl and Jekyll:

* Directory structure
* Use of YAML front matter in Pages and Posts
* Availability of `site`, `content`, `page` and `posts` variables in templates
* Copies all static files into destination directory

Notable differences between jkl and Jekyll:

* Uses [Go templates](http://www.golang.org/pkg/text/template)
* Only supports YAML front matter in markup files
* No plugin support

Additional features:

* Deploy to S3

Sites built with jkl:

* Drone.io Blog: http://blog.drone.io
* Drone.io Documentation: http://docs.drone.io

### Installation

In order to compile with `go build` you will first need to download
the following dependencies:

```
go get github.com/russross/blackfriday
go get launchpad.net/goyaml
go get launchpad.net/goamz/aws
go get launchpad.net/goamz/s3
go get github.com/dersebi/golang_exp/exp/inotify
```
Once you have compiled `jkl` you can install with the following command:

```sh
sudo install -t /usr/local/bin jkl
```

If you are running x64 linux you can download and install the pre-compiled
binary:

```sh
wget https://github.com/downloads/bradrydzewski/jkl/jkl
sudo install -t /usr/local/bin jkl
```

### Usage

```
Usage: jkl [OPTION]... [SOURCE]

      --auto           re-generates the site when files are modified
      --base-url       serve website from a given base URL
      --source         changes the dir where Jekyll will look to transform files
      --destination    changes the dir where Jekyll will write files to
      --server         starts a server that will host your _site directory
      --server-port    changes the port that the Jekyll server will run on
      --s3             copies the _site directory to s3
  -v, --verbose        runs Jekyll with verbose output
  -h, --help           display this help and exit

Examples:
  jkl                  generates site from current working dir
  jkl --server         generates site and serves at localhost:4000
  jkl /path/to/site    generates site from source dir /path/to/site

```

### Auto Generation

If you are running the website in server mode, with the `--server` flag, you can
also instruct `jkl` to auto-recompile you website by adding the `--auto` flag.

NOTE: this feature is only available on Linux

### Deployment

In order to deploy to S3 you must include a `_jekyll_s3.yml` file in your
site's root directory that specifies your AWS key, secret and bucket:

```
s3_id: YOUR_AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID
s3_secret: YOUR_AWS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
s3_bucket: your.blog.bucket.com
```

Run `jkl --s3`
